# NorgesGruppen Data: Object Detection

Detect grocery products on store shelves. Upload your model code as a `.zip` file — it runs in a sandboxed Docker container on our servers.

## How It Works

1. Download the training data from the competition website (requires login)
2. Train your object detection model locally
3. Write a `run.py` that takes shelf images as input and outputs predictions
4. Zip your code + model weights
5. Upload at the submit page
6. Our server runs your code in a sandbox with GPU (NVIDIA L4, 24 GB VRAM) — no network access
7. Your predictions are scored: **70% detection** (did you find products?) + **30% classification** (did you identify the right product?)
8. Score appears on the leaderboard

## Downloads

Download training data and product reference images from the **Submit** page on the competition website (login required).

## Training Data

Two files are available for download:

**COCO Dataset** (`NM_NGD_coco_dataset.zip`, ~864 MB)
- 248 shelf images from Norwegian grocery stores
- ~22,700 COCO-format bounding box annotations
- 356 product categories (category_id 0-355) — detect and identify grocery products
- Images from 4 store sections: Egg, Frokost, Knekkebrod, Varmedrikker

**Product Reference Images** (`NM_NGD_product_images.zip`, ~60 MB)
- 327 individual products with multi-angle photos (main, front, back, left, right, top, bottom)
- Organized by barcode: `{product_code}/main.jpg`, `{product_code}/front.jpg`, etc.
- Includes `metadata.json` with product names and annotation counts

### Annotation Format

The COCO annotations file (`annotations.json`) contains:

```json
{
  "images": [
    {"id": 1, "file_name": "img_00001.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1500}
  ],
  "categories": [
    {"id": 0, "name": "VESTLANDSLEFSA TØRRE 10STK 360G", "supercategory": "product"},
    {"id": 1, "name": "COFFEE MATE 180G NESTLE", "supercategory": "product"},
    ...
    {"id": 356, "name": "unknown_product", "supercategory": "product"}
  ],
  "annotations": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "image_id": 1,
      "category_id": 42,
      "bbox": [141, 49, 169, 152],
      "area": 25688,
      "iscrowd": 0,
      "product_code": "8445291513365",
      "product_name": "NESCAFE VANILLA LATTE 136G NESTLE",
      "corrected": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Key fields: `bbox` is `[x, y, width, height]` in pixels (COCO format). `product_code` is the barcode. `corrected` indicates manually verified annotations.

## Submit

Upload your `.zip` at the submission page on the competition website.

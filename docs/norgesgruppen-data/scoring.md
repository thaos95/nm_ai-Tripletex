# NorgesGruppen Data: Scoring

## Hybrid Scoring

Your final score combines detection and classification:

```
Score = 0.7 × detection_mAP + 0.3 × classification_mAP
```

Both components use mAP@0.5 (Mean Average Precision at IoU threshold 0.5).

### Detection mAP (70% of score)

Measures whether you found the products, ignoring category:

- Each prediction is matched to the closest ground truth box
- A prediction is a true positive if IoU ≥ 0.5 (category is ignored)
- This rewards accurate bounding box localization

### Classification mAP (30% of score)

Measures whether you identified the correct product:

- A prediction is a true positive if IoU ≥ 0.5 AND the `category_id` matches the ground truth
- 356 product categories (IDs 0-355) from the training data `annotations.json`

### Detection-Only Submissions

If you set `category_id: 0` for all predictions, you can score up to **0.70** (70%) from the detection component alone. Adding correct product identification unlocks the remaining 30%.

- Score range: 0.0 (worst) to 1.0 (perfect)

## Submission Limits

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Submissions in-flight | 2 per team |
| Submissions per day | 3 per team |
| Infrastructure failure freebies | 2 per day (don't count against your 3) |

Limits reset at midnight UTC. If you hit an infrastructure error (our fault), it doesn't count against your daily limit — up to 2 per day. After that, infrastructure failures consume a regular submission slot.

## Leaderboard

The public leaderboard shows scores from the public test set. The final ranking uses the private test set which is never revealed to participants.

## Select for Final Evaluation

By default, your best-scoring submission is used for the final private evaluation. You can override this by clicking **Select for final** on any completed submission in your submission history. This lets you choose a submission you trust, even if it's not your highest public score. You can change your selection at any time before the competition ends.

# API Endpoint Specification

## Base URL

```
https://api.ainm.no/astar-island
```

All endpoints require authentication. The API accepts either:

- **Cookie:** `access_token` JWT cookie (set automatically when you log in at app.ainm.no)
- **Bearer token:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

Both methods use the same JWT token. Use whichever is more convenient for your setup.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "uuid",
    "round_number": 1,
    "event_date": "2026-03-19",
    "status": "active",
    "map_width": 40,

  }
]
```

### Round Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Round created but not yet started |
| `active` | Queries and submissions open |
| `scoring` | Submissions closed, scoring in progress |
| `completed` | Scores finalized |

## GET /astar-island/rounds/{round_id}

Returns round details including **initial map states** for all seeds. Use this to reconstruct the starting terrain locally.

**Note:** Settlement data in initial states shows only position and port status. Internal stats (population, food, wealth, defense) are not exposed.

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "round_number": 1,
  "status": "active",
  "map_width": 40,
  "map_height": 40,
  "seeds_count": 5,
  "initial_states": [
    {
      "grid": [[10, 10, 10, "..."], "..."],
      "settlements": [
        {
          "x": 5, "y": 12,
          "has_port": true,
          "alive": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Grid Cell Values

| Value | Terrain |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | Empty |
| 1 | Settlement |
| 2 | Port |
| 3 | Ruin |
| 4 | Forest |
| 5 | Mountain |
| 10 | Ocean |
| 11 | Plains |

## GET /astar-island/budget

Check your team's remaining query budget for the active round.

```json
{
  "round_id": "uuid",
  "queries_used": 23,
  "queries_max": 50,
  "active": true
}
```

## Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| `POST /simulate` | 5 requests/second per team |
| `POST /submit` | 2 requests/second per team |

Exceeding these limits returns `429 Too Many Requests`.

## POST /astar-island/simulate

**This is the core observation endpoint.** Each call runs one stochastic simulation and reveals a viewport window of the result. Costs one query from your budget (50 per round).

### Request

```json
{
  "round_id": "uuid-of-active-round",
  "seed_index": 3,
  "viewport_x": 10,
  "viewport_y": 5,
  "viewport_w": 15,
  "viewport_h": 15
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `round_id` | string | UUID of the active round |
| `seed_index` | int (0-4) | Which of the 5 seeds to simulate |
| `viewport_x` | int (>=0) | Left edge of viewport (default 0) |
| `viewport_y` | int (>=0) | Top edge of viewport (default 0) |
| `viewport_w` | int (5-15) | Viewport width (default 15) |
| `viewport_h` | int (5-15) | Viewport height (default 15) |

### Response

```json
{
  "grid": [[4, 11, 1, "..."], "..."],
  "settlements": [
    {
      "x": 12, "y": 7,
      "population": 2.8,
      "food": 0.4,
      "wealth": 0.7,
      "defense": 0.6,
      "has_port": true,
      "alive": true,
      "owner_id": 3
    }
  ],
  "viewport": {"x": 10, "y": 5, "w": 15, "h": 15},
  "width": 40,
  "height": 40,
  "queries_used": 24,
  "queries_max": 50
}
```

The `grid` contains only the viewport region (viewport_h x viewport_w), not the full map. The `settlements` list includes only settlements within the viewport. The `viewport` object confirms the actual viewport bounds (clamped to map edges). `width` and `height` give the full map dimensions.

Each call uses a different random sim_seed, so you get a different stochastic outcome.

### Error Codes

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 400 | Round not active, or invalid seed_index |
| 403 | Not on a team |
| 404 | Round not found |
| 429 | Query budget exhausted (50/50) or rate limit exceeded (max 5 req/sec) |

## POST /astar-island/submit

Submit your prediction for one seed. You must submit all 5 seeds for a complete score.

### Request

```json
{
  "round_id": "uuid-of-active-round",
  "seed_index": 3,
  "prediction": [
    [
      [0.85, 0.05, 0.02, 0.03, 0.03, 0.02],
      [0.10, 0.40, 0.30, 0.10, 0.05, 0.05]
    ]
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `round_id` | string | UUID of the active round |
| `seed_index` | int (0-4) | Which seed this prediction is for |
| `prediction` | float[][][] | HxWx6 tensor — probability per cell per class |

### Prediction Format

The `prediction` is a 3D array: `prediction[y][x][class]`

- Outer dimension: **H** rows (height)
- Middle dimension: **W** columns (width)
- Inner dimension: **6** probabilities (one per class)
- Each cell's 6 probabilities must sum to 1.0 (+/-0.01 tolerance)
- All probabilities must be non-negative

### Class Indices

| Index | Class |
|-------|-------|
| 0 | Empty (Ocean, Plains, Empty) |
| 1 | Settlement |
| 2 | Port |
| 3 | Ruin |
| 4 | Forest |
| 5 | Mountain |

### Response

```json
{
  "status": "accepted",
  "round_id": "uuid",
  "seed_index": 3
}
```

Resubmitting for the same seed overwrites your previous prediction. Only the last submission counts.

### Validation Errors

| Error | Cause |
|-------|-------|
| `Expected H rows, got N` | Wrong number of rows |
| `Row Y: expected W cols, got N` | Wrong number of columns |
| `Cell (Y,X): expected 6 probs, got N` | Wrong probability vector length |
| `Cell (Y,X): probs sum to S, expected 1.0` | Probabilities don't sum to 1.0 |
| `Cell (Y,X): negative probability` | Negative value in probability vector |

# Astar Island Quickstart

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication. Log in at app.ainm.no, then inspect cookies in your browser to grab your `access_token` JWT.

You can authenticate using either a cookie or a Bearer token header:

```python
import requests

BASE = "https://api.ainm.no"

# Option 1: Cookie-based auth
session = requests.Session()
session.cookies.set("access_token", "YOUR_JWT_TOKEN")

# Option 2: Bearer token auth
session = requests.Session()
session.headers["Authorization"] = "Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Step 1: Get the Active Round

```python
rounds = session.get(f"{BASE}/astar-island/rounds").json()
active = next((r for r in rounds if r["status"] == "active"), None)

if active:
    round_id = active["id"]
    print(f"Active round: {active['round_number']}")
```

## Step 2: Get Round Details

Fetch the detail endpoint to get full round info including `seeds_count` and initial states:

```python
detail = session.get(f"{BASE}/astar-island/rounds/{round_id}").json()

width = detail["map_width"]      # 40
height = detail["map_height"]    # 40
seeds = detail["seeds_count"]    # 5
print(f"Round: {width}x{height}, {seeds} seeds")

for i, state in enumerate(detail["initial_states"]):
    grid = state["grid"]           # height x width terrain codes
    settlements = state["settlements"]  # [{x, y, has_port, alive}, ...]
    print(f"Seed {i}: {len(settlements)} settlements")
```

## Step 3: Query the Simulator

You have 50 queries per round, shared across all seeds. Each query reveals a 5-15 cell wide viewport:

```python
result = session.post(f"{BASE}/astar-island/simulate", json={
    "round_id": round_id,
    "seed_index": 0,
    "viewport_x": 10,
    "viewport_y": 5,
    "viewport_w": 15,
    "viewport_h": 15,
}).json()

grid = result["grid"]                # 15x15 terrain after simulation
settlements = result["settlements"]  # settlements in viewport with full stats
viewport = result["viewport"]        # {x, y, w, h}
```

## Step 4: Build and Submit Predictions

For each seed, submit a `height x width x 6` probability tensor. Each cell has 6 values representing the probability of each terrain class (Empty, Settlement, Port, Ruin, Forest, Mountain). They must sum to 1.0:

```python
import numpy as np

for seed_idx in range(seeds):
    prediction = np.full((height, width, 6), 1/6)  # uniform baseline

    # TODO: replace with your model's predictions
    # prediction[y][x] = [p_empty, p_settlement, p_port, p_ruin, p_forest, p_mountain]

    resp = session.post(f"{BASE}/astar-island/submit", json={
        "round_id": round_id,
        "seed_index": seed_idx,
        "prediction": prediction.tolist(),
    })
    print(f"Seed {seed_idx}: {resp.status_code}")
```

A uniform prediction scores ~1-5. Use your queries to build better predictions.

> **Warning:** Never assign probability 0.0 to any class. If the ground truth has any non-zero probability for a class you marked as zero, KL divergence becomes infinite and your score for that cell is destroyed. Always enforce a minimum floor (e.g., 0.01) and renormalize.

## Using the MCP Server

Add the documentation server to Claude Code for AI-assisted development:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http nmiai https://mcp-docs.ainm.no/mcp
```

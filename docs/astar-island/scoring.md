# Astar Island Scoring

## Score Formula

Your score is based on **entropy-weighted KL divergence** between your prediction and the ground truth.

### Ground Truth

For each seed, the organizers pre-compute ground truth by running the simulation **hundreds of times** with the true hidden parameters. This produces a probability distribution for each cell.

For example, a cell might have ground truth `[0.0, 0.60, 0.25, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0]` — meaning 60% chance of Settlement, 25% Port, 15% Ruin, after 50 years.

### KL Divergence

For each cell, the [KL divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) measures how different your prediction is from the ground truth:

```
KL(p || q) = Σ pi × log(pi / qi)
```

Where `p` = ground truth, `q` = your prediction. Lower KL = better match.

### Entropy Weighting

Not all cells are equally important. Static cells (ocean stays ocean, mountain stays mountain) have near-zero entropy and are excluded from scoring.

**Only dynamic cells** (those that change between simulation runs) contribute to your score, weighted by their entropy:

```
entropy(cell) = -Σ pi × log(pi)
```

Cells with higher entropy (more uncertain outcomes) count more toward your score. This focuses scoring on the interesting parts of the map.

### Final Score

```
weighted_kl = Σ entropy(cell) × KL(ground_truth[cell], prediction[cell])
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                            Σ entropy(cell)

score = max(0, min(100, 100 × exp(-3 × weighted_kl)))
```

- **100** = perfect prediction (your distribution matches ground truth exactly)
- **0** = terrible prediction (high KL divergence)
- The exponential decay means small improvements in prediction accuracy yield diminishing score gains

## Common Pitfalls

**Never assign probability 0.0 to any class.** KL divergence includes the term `pi × log(pi / qi)`. If the ground truth has `pi > 0` but your prediction has `qi = 0`, the divergence goes to **infinity** — destroying your entire score for that cell.

Even if you're confident a cell is Forest, the ground truth may assign a small probability to Settlement or Ruin across thousands of simulations. A single zero in your prediction can tank your score.

**Recommendation:** Always enforce a minimum probability floor of **0.01** per class, then renormalize so the values still sum to 1.0:

```python
prediction = np.maximum(prediction, 0.01)
prediction = prediction / prediction.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
```

This small safety margin costs almost nothing in score but protects against catastrophic KL blowups.

## Per-Round Score

Each round has **5 seeds**. Your round score is the **average** of your per-seed scores:

```
round_score = (score_seed_0 + score_seed_1 + ... + score_seed_4) / 5
```

If you don't submit a prediction for a seed, that seed scores **0**. Always submit something for every seed — even a uniform prediction beats 0.

## Leaderboard

Your leaderboard score is your **best round score of all time**:

```
leaderboard_score = max(round_score) across all rounds
```

Later rounds may have higher weights, meaning a good score on a later round counts for more. Only your single best result matters — keep improving your model across rounds.

A **hot streak score** (average of your last 3 rounds) is also tracked.

## Game End

Each round has a **prediction window** (typically 2 hours 45 minutes). After the window closes:

1. Round status changes to `scoring`
2. All predictions are scored against ground truth
3. Per-seed scores are averaged to compute round score
4. Leaderboard updates with weighted averages
5. Round status changes to `completed`
